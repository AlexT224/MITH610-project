<p>The Negro's advance into the <orgName>University</orgName><lb/>
<!-- I find the way they say "The Negro" very interesting. It sounds like an animal documentary-->
was slow, but in the 1950's his pace quick-­<lb/>
ened. <persName>Parren J. Mitchell</persName>, a Negro gradu­-<lb/>
ate student in sociology, had applied to the<lb/>
<orgName>University</orgName> in August of 1950. <persName>Mitchell</persName> was<lb/>
accepted with the tacit understanding that<lb/>
he attend classes in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>--not in<lb/>
<placeName>College Park</placeName>.</p><lb/>
<p>These “regrettable* situations came<lb/>
to a close in the early fifties. Slowly,<lb/>
the Board of Regents and the Supreme<lb/>
Court passed holdings liberalizing edu-­<lb/>
cation facilities.</p><lb/>
<p>In May of 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court<lb/>
struck down the ‘‘separate but equal,""<lb/>
doctrine and held that public education<lb/>
institutions must be integrated (Brown<lb/>
v. Board of Education). The following<lb/>
month the Board of Regents unanimously<lb/>
passed the motion that "all qualified stu­-<lb/>
dents resident of <placeName>Maryland</placeName> may apply<lb/>
for admission to the <orgName>University</orgName> in all<lb/>
of its schools."</p><lb/>
<p> In 1955, following the embarrassing<lb/>
incident with the D.C. Recreation Depart-­<lb/>
ment, the Board moved to extend the <cb/><lb/>
non-racial policy to out-of-state appli­-<lb/>
cants. </p><lb/>
<p>The <orgName>University</orgName> at last had an integrated<lb/>
admissions policy. It was twenty years<lb/>
since <persName>Donald Gaines Murray</persName> had appealed<lb/>
his case for admission to the <orgName>University<lb/>
Law School</orgName>. It was four years since a<lb/>
Negro student had entered <orgName>College park</orgName>.</p><lb/>
<p>Now that the policy gates had opened,<lb/>
how was integration effected within the<lb/>
<placeName>College park</placeName> campus? Integration was a<lb/>
reality on paper, but socially and ad­-<lb/>
ministratively the Negro was still feeling<lb/>
his way. The Negro and the fourteenth<lb/>
amendment were yet to expand. </p><lb/>
<p>The conclusion was “yes, there ought<lb/>
to be discussion,” The Court ruled in<lb/>
<persName>Mitchell’s</persName> favor, declaring that “counsel<lb/>
shows certain advantages in studying at<lb/>
<orgName>College park</orgName>. . .weekly seminars are<lb/>
more profitable in large classes."</p><lb/>
<p>While <persName>Mitchell</persName> set to work for his<lb/>
Masters degree a State investigative<lb/>
body, the <orgName>Weglein Commission</orgName>, looked<lb/>
into “Negro Higher Education in the<lb/>
State.” Finding a wide disparity between<lb/>
Negro and white educational facilities,<lb/>
the Committee proposed that the “State<lb/>
admit Negroes to graduate and profes-­<lb/>
sional schools when it was impractical<cb/><lb/>
to offer equal education opportunities at<lb/>
separate Negro institutions."</p><lb/>
<p>The State’s last-minute programs to<lb/>
step up separate Negro education facili­-<lb/>
ties apparently were not advancing fast<lb/>
enough to combat the drive toward inte­-<lb/>
gration. The Board of Regents examined<lb/>
the Weglein recommendations and in<lb/>
April, 1951, the Board promulgated a new<lb/>
racial policy:</p><lb/>
<p>In the future all resident applicants<lb/>
within the <placeName>state</placeName>, regardless of race, color<lb/>
or creed, were to be considered for<lb/>
admission to the professional schools<lb/>
in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> on an equal basis with<lb/>
white applicants.</p><lb/>
<p>In line with this policy ruling, in<lb/>
May of that year, two Negroes were ad­-<lb/>
mitted to the <orgName>Medical School</orgName>, an institu-<lb/>­
tion that had been white for 144 years.</p><lb/>
<p>The new integration policy ran smooth­-<lb/>
ly for several months, until another<lb/>
hassle arose in July, 1952. <persName>Wendall A.<lb/>
Paris</persName>, assistant athletic director to the<lb/>
<orgName>D.C. Public Schools</orgName> and a Negro, was<lb/>
denied admission to a summer school<lb/>
graduate course in <placeName>College park</placeName>.</p><lb/>
<p><orgName>The University</orgName> apologized to <persName>Paris</persName>,<lb/>
but informed that the school’s policy of <cb/><lb/>
accepting Negro students did not apply<lb/>
to out-of-state applicants. If <persName>Paris</persName> had<lb/>
been white, he would have been accepted.</p><lb/>
<p>In 1955 a similar incident occurred.<lb/>
<orgName>The University</orgName> had invited members of<lb/>
the <orgName>D.C. Recreation Department</orgName> to take<lb/>
a summer course at <placeName>College park</placeName>. Ten<lb/>
workers applied. All were initially ac-­<lb/>
cepted.</p><lb/>
<p>However, six of these applications<lb/>
were from Negroes, and when the Uni-­<lb/>
versity administration realized this,<lb/>
those applicants were rejected. They<lb/>
were returned their money and informed<lb/>
that the school did not admit out-of-state<lb/>
Negroes.</p><lb/>
<p>In protest, the Recreation Superintend-<lb/>­
ent withdrew the four other white appli-­<lb/>
cants.</p><lb/>
<p>The Board of Regents, commenting<lb/>
on the incident, said that the situation<lb/>
was “regrettable." The Board would<lb/>
make efforts to negotiate for such<lb/>
a course for D.C. employees within the<lb/>
District.</p><lb/>
<p>"We hadn’t accepted Negroes before,<lb/>
but there wasn’t anything the matter with<lb/>
this application," recalls <persName>Harold <pb/><lb/>
Hoffsomer</persName>, former head of the<lb/>
Department of Sociology.</p><lb/>
<p>“The President <persName>(Byrd)</persName> said our<lb/>
policy was to give them equal<lb/>
opportunities. We would give<lb/>
them chances to get their educa­-<lb/>
tion, but we wouldn't do it on the<lb/>
campus in <placeName>College Park</placeName>."</p><lb/>
<cb/>
<p>“This man wanted to major in<lb/>
sociology," continued <choice> <sic>Hoffsomar</sic> <corr>Hoffsomer</corr></choice>,<lb/>
•and I told <persName>President Byrd</persName> at the<lb/>
time that one of the required<lb/>
courses in sociology was my<lb/>
methods in sociological research<lb/>
and that course wasn’t given in<lb/>
<placeName>Baltimore</placeName>."</p><lb/>
<p>He further told <persName>Byrd</persName> that, “if<lb/>
we wanted to make things equal...<lb/>
I would have to give the course<lb/>
myself. I told President <persName>Byrd</persName><lb/>
It would cost money, but he said<lb/>
okay."</p><lb/>
<p>Consequently, the methodology<lb/>
class--a seminar course--was<lb/>
included in the Baltimore Cam­-<lb/>
pus, <orgName>University College</orgName> curricul­-<lb/>
um for the fall semester, 1950.</p><lb/>
<p><persName>Mitchell</persName>, however, was not<lb/>
pleased that "separate but equal"<lb/>
accommodations had been ar­-<lb/>
ranged especially for him. In<lb/>
Sept., 1950, he took his grievances<lb/>
to court, and in “Mitchell<lb/>
v. Byrd," he claimed that because<lb/>
of his skin color he was being<lb/>
“denied advantages of associa­-<lb/>
tion with other students."</p><lb/>
<p>He was the only student regis­-<lb/>
tered for the methodology class<lb/>
in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>. He felt the crea-<lb/>­
tion of a “one-man seminar" un­-<lb/>
<supplied>just.</supplied></p><lb/>
<p>In court, <persName>Ronald Bamford</persName>, Dean<lb/>
of the Graduate School, testified<lb/>
that, “there is no question that if<lb/>
he <persName>(Mitchell)</persName> had been a white<lb/>
man, he could have been assigned<lb/>
as a student at <placeName>College Park</placeName>.</p><lb/>
