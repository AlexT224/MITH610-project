  <cb/>
<p>The serious shortage of physicians and
dentists this <placeName>nation</placeName> faces is a fact ac­
knowledged by federal experts and public
alike. However, one of the least known
aspects of this problem is the appalling
shortage of black physicians and dentists.</p>
<p>Among white Americans, one out of
every 670 is a physician but among black</p>
<!-- There is a picture in the middle of the paragraph -->
<p>Americans, only one in 5,000 practices
medicine. Whereas there is one dentist
for every 1,750 Americans there is only
one black dentist for every 10,000 black
Americans.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is that there
<cb/>
are far too few black college students
who enter medical and dental schools.
There appear to be four principal rea­
sons that these schools are not attract­
ing a sufficient number of qualified <persName ref="#BLK">Negro</persName>
applicants.</p>
<p>The first reason is that among Negro
college students, many lack the life-long
academic preparation necessary to
pursue the highly demanding and com­
petitive pre-dental and pre-medical cur­
ricula.</p>
<p>Secondly, a lack of communication ex­
ists between medical and dental schools
and black undergraduates, resulting in a
belief among the latter that racial origin
is a serious deterrent to a career in med­
icine or dentistry.</p>
<p>The third reason is that many black
students feel the cost of dental or med­
ical education would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>The fourth is that many black students
are unaware of the opportunities which
would be opened to them as physicians
and dentists.</p>
<p>We feel that these four reasons should
not deter any black student on this cam­
pus from the attainment of worthwhile
careers in dentistry or medicine.</p>
<p>For the black student who finds his
background inadequate in any subject, he
can readily obtain tutoring assistance by
<cb/>
contacting his instructor, the study skills
program of the <orgName>Counseling Center</orgName>; the
freshman hoaoraries, <orgName>Phi Eta Sigma</orgName> and
<orgName>Alpha Lambda Delta</orgName>; the honors dorms,
<placeName>Cambridge A</placeName> and <placeName>Hagerstown 5th</placeName>; the
Junior affiliates of the <orgName>American Chem­
ical Society</orgName> and other departmental hon­
oraries.</p>
<p>For the black student who is concerned
about any problem he might encounter as
a Negro applicant, the <orgName>Pre-Dental and
Pre-Medical societies</orgName> will offer their
assistance in obtaining pertinent and re­
liable information.</p>
<p>Concerning racial discrimination in
medicine, we quote an article from
<orgName>Ebony</orgName> magazine:</p>
<p>The various clinical colleges and
academies, like the <orgName>American College
of Surgeons</orgName> and the <orgName>American Col­
lege of Physicians</orgName> have practically
eliminated their racial bars so that
Negro physicians are admitted just as
others, as soon as properly qualified
and sponsored.</p>
<p>Similarly, the various specialty
boards certify Negro physicians as
specialists without restriction when
they have met the respective training
requirements and passed the examin­
ations.</p>
<p>For the black student who needs finan­
cial assistance, there are numerous
awards available from professional
schools, medical societies, Federal and
state governments, and various other
sources.</p>
<p>Again quoting from <orgName>Ebony</orgName>, "Today
there are more medical school openings
available to Negro students than there can
be found qualified applicants to fill." For
example, <orgName>Harvard Medical School</orgName> plans
to provide at least 15 scholarships per
class for disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>For the black student, a career in den­
tistry or medicine offers the opportunity
for a constructive role in attaining social,
economic, and political equality in any
community.</p>
<p><roleName>President</roleName> <persName>Johnson</persName> proclaimed to mem­
bers of the <orgName> National Medical Associa­
tion</orgName> in a recent address that Negro
professional men must be their "broth­
ers' keepers" and "...must provide the
leadership, the brains and courage."</p>
<!-- How is it their responsibilty for your lack of outreach? -->
<p>The <orgName>Pre-Dental and Pre-Medical so­
cieties</orgName> strongly urge any black students
interested in these professions to in­
vestigate our programs.</p>
